Challenges Faced

Early Research:
1. Decided to use Vue over React
2. Settting up Vue for the first time
3. Choosing to use the ATOMIC Organizational Practice
4. Deciding if I should use a database for login information
4a. This conflicts with my idea of wanting to upload the website on github
4b. Maybe I can use html5 storage? (need research)
5. Deciding to use Bootstrap over Tailwind

Implementation:
1. Learning how to use bootstrap
2. Learning to create an inverted curve in elements (ultimately used a bg img)
3. Practice using pseudo elements
4. Working with manually positioned images
5. Building a Carousel
--Read js function for the centering animation on the carousel
--animate in the carousel images. I'll probably need to review how HBO is doing this in javascript.
