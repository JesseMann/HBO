Challenges Faced

Early Research:
1. Decided to use Vue over React
2. Settting up Vue for the first time
3. Choosing to use the ATOMIC Organizational Practice
4. Deciding if I should use a database for login information
4a. This conflicts with my idea of wanting to upload the website on github
4b. Maybe I can use html5 storage? (need research)
5. Deciding to use Bootstrap over Tailwind

Implementation:
1. Learning how to use bootstrap
2. Learning to create an inverted curve in elements (ultimately used a bg img)
3. Practice using pseudo elements
4. Working with manually positioned images
5. Building a Carousel
6. Project Management (ended up used github "projects")

Implementation:
1. Choosing Vue CLI setup over NPM-direct setup and CDN setup.
2. Learning about routers
3. Learning about local styles (scoped), vs global styles, vs module styles. Chose local styles.
4. Learning about props
5. Learning about retrieve data via API to use dynamically
6. Learning about carousel sliding
7. Learning about file naming and management
8. Learning about re-useable components
9. Learning about Vue's dynamic component options

Future To Dos
1. Minimize number of service files; make less files and have them be more re-usable
2. Update Load Time of images
