Challenges Faced

Early Research:
1. Decided to use Vue over React
2. Settting up Vue for the first time
3. Choosing to use the ATOMIC Organizational Practice
4. Deciding if I should use a database for login information
4a. This conflicts with my idea of wanting to upload the website on github
4b. Maybe I can use html5 storage? (need research)
5. Deciding to use Bootstrap over Tailwind

Implementation:
1. Learning how to use bootstrap
2. Learning to create an inverted curve in elements (ultimately used a bg img)
3. Practice using pseudo elements
4. Working with manually positioned images
5. Building a Carousel
--animate out for non active elements javascript
--

if slide.bs.carousel (event fired when slide is activated) and event direction is right, then
active .img-anim-out class for the element before it

if slide.bs.carousel (event fired when slide is activated) and event direction is left, then
activate .img-anim-out class for the element after it


add the img out class to the element before the active carousel item

If the carousel moves left, fire function
If the carousel moves right, fire function
Do this by adding the slide carousel hook Direction
The function may have some confusion about how to add a class.
- If that's the case, we'll need to debug
